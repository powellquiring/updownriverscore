# Up and Down the River score keeper
This game is for keeping score, try it [out here](https://riv.powellquiring.com), it is just for keeping score you need a deck of cards to play the game.

It is
- built using github actions (standard setup as determined by the builder looking at my project).
- Deployed to github pages.
- DNS redirect which only worked when the CNAME file was added to the root.


 It was generated mostly using AI tools including:

- firebase studio - initially, generated the nextjs app and deployed initially to firebase
- Augment - worked great
- Cursor
